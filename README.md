# Tic Tac Toe Game

![Example Game Picture](example-game.jpeg)

Have you ever played Tic Tac Toe before? I am sure you have played. So it's time to play again (no, I'm not a tv commercial)! A simple browser-based Tic Tac Toe game with JavaScript.

No installation is required, just open the 'index.html' file in the project folder in the web browser of your choice.
So what happens when the game is over? Nothing, seriously nothing.
So what do I do? Play it again then.
